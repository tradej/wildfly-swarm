= MicroProfile Fault Tolerance

This fraction implements the https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-fault-tolerance[Eclipse MicroProfile Fault Tolerance API^].
The implementation depends on the xref:_hystrix[Hystrix fraction], which is added transitively into your application.
Use xref:configuring-a-thorntail-application_{context}[standard configuration mechanisms] to configure Hystrix properties in your application.

== Bulkhead fallback rejection

If you use the semaphore-style `@Bulkhead` pattern with a `@Fallback` logic to limit the number of concurrent requests, the invocation may still result in a `BulkheadException` if the maximum concurrent limit for the `HystrixCommand.getFallback()` method is reached.
To avoid that, set the `swarm.hystrix.command.default.fallback.isolation.semaphore.maxConcurrentRequests` property to increase the limit.
