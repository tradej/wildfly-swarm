= Specifying a BOM for in your application

Importing a specific BOM in the `pom.xml` file in your application allows you to track all your application dependencies in one place.

[NOTE]
====
One shortcoming of importing a Maven BOM import is that it does not handle the configuration on the level of `<pluginManagement>`. When you use the {Thorntail} Maven Plugin, you must specify the version of the plugin to use.

Thanks to the property you use in your `pom.xml` file, you can easily ensure that your plugin usage matches the release of {Thorntail} that you are targeting with the BOM import.

[source,xml]
----
<plugins>
  <plugin>
include::../resources/pom/bom/pom.xml[tag=plugin,indent=4]
      ...
  </plugin>
</plugins>

.Prerequisites

* Your application as a Maven-based project with a `pom.xml` file.

.Procedure

. Include a `bom` artifact in your `pom.xml`.

Tracking the current version of {Thorntail} through a property in your `pom.xml` is recommended.

[source,xml,subs="+attributes"]
----
<properties>
  <version.thorntail>{version}</version.thorntail>
</properties>
----

Import BOMs in the `<dependencyManagement>` section. Specify the `<type>pom</type>` and `<scope>import</scope>`.

[source,xml]
----
<dependencyManagement>
  <dependencies>
include::../resources/pom/bom/pom.xml[tag=bom-dependency,indent=4]
  </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----

In the example above, the `bom` artifact is imported to ensure that only stable fractions are available.


ifndef::product[]
If you want to experiment with some unstable fractions in addition to the stable ones, uncomment the `<dependency>` for `bom-unstable`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependencyManagement>
  <dependencies>
include::../resources/pom/bom/pom.xml[tag=bom-dependency,indent=4]
include::../resources/pom/bom/pom.xml[tag=bom-unstable-dependency,indent=4]
  </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----

Remember, each flavor of `bom`, with the exception of `bom-all` contains only the type of fractions indicated.  This allows mixing and matching the combination of fraction stability that you want with fine granularity. If you want both stable and unstable, you would need to include both `bom-stable` (or `bom`) and `bom-unstable`.
endif::[]

By including the BOMs of your choice in the `<dependencyManagement>` section, you have:

* Provided version-management for any {Thorntail} artifacts you subsequently *choose* to use.
* Provided support to your IDE for auto-completing known artifacts when you edit your the `pom.xml` file of your application.

. Include {Thorntail} dependencies.
+
--
Even though you imported the {Thorntail} BOMs in the `<dependencyManagement>` section, your application still has no dependencies on {Thorntail} artifacts.

To include {Thorntail} artifact dependencies based on the capabilities your application, enter the relevant artifacts as `<dependency>` elements:

NOTE: You do not have to specify the version of the artifacts because the BOM imported in `<dependencyManagement>` handles that.

[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
include::../resources/pom/bom/pom.xml[tag=fraction-dependencies,indent=2]
</dependencies>
----

In the example above, we include explicit dependencies on the `jaxrs` and `datasources` fractions, which will provide transitive inclusion of others, for example `undertow`.
