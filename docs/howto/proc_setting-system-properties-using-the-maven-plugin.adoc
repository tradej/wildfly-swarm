= Setting system properties using the Maven plugin

Setting properties using the Maven plugin is useful for temporarily changing a configuration item for a single execution of your {Thorntail} application.

NOTE: Even though the configuration in the POM file of your application is persistent, it is not recommended to use it for long-term configuration of your application.
Instead, use the xref:configuring-an-application-using-yaml_{context}[YAML configuration files].

If you want to set explicit configuration values as defaults through the Maven plugin, add a `<properties>` section to the `<configuration>` block of the plugin in the `pom.xml` file in your application.

        </properties>
      </configuration>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>

In the example above, the `swarm.bind.address` property is set to `127.0.0.1` and the `java.net.preferIPv4Stack` property is set to `true`.
