= {Thorntail} Maven plugin configuration properties

Properties can be used to configure the execution and affect the packaging or running of your application.

If you add a `<properties>` or `<propertiesFile>` section to the `<configuration>` of the plugin, the properties are used when executing your application using the `mvn thorntail:run` command.
In addition to that, the same properties are added to your `_myapp_-thorntail.jar` file to affect subsequent executions of the uberjar.
Any properties loaded from the `<propertiesFile>` override identically-named properties in the `<properties>` section.

Any properties added to the uberjar can be overridden at runtime using the traditional `-Dname=value` mechanism of the `java` binary, or using the YAML-based configuration files.

Only the following properties are added to the uberjar at package time:

* The properties specified outside of the `<properties>` section or the `<propertiesFile>`, whose path starts with one of the following:
** `jboss.`
** `wildfly.`
** `swarm.`
** `maven.`
* The properties that override a property specified in the `<properties>` section or the `<propertiesFile>`.
