= Specifying JDBC drivers for hollow JARs

When executing a hollow JAR, you can specify a JDBC Driver JAR using the `swarm.classpath` property.
This way, you do not need to package the driver in the hollow JAR.

The `swarm.classpath` property accepts one or more paths to JAR files separated by `;` (a semicolon).
The specified JAR files are added to the classpath of the application.
