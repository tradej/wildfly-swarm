= {Thorntail} Maven plugin goals

The {Thorntail} Maven plugin provides several goals:

package::
Creates the executable package (see xref:creating-an-uberjar_{context}[]).

run::
Executes your application in the Maven process. The application is stopped if the Maven build is interrupted, for example when you press Ctrl + C.

[#maven-plugin-multistart-goal]
start and multistart::
Executes your application in a forked process. Generally, it is only useful for running integration tests using a plugin, such as the `maven-failsafe-plugin`.
The `multistart` variant allows starting multiple {Thorntail}{ndash}built applications using Maven GAVs to support complex testing scenarios.

stop::
Stops any previously started applications.
+
NOTE: The `stop` goal can only stop applications that were started _in the same Maven execution_.
